- Today's programming wisdom is to always prioritize your time and focus on the most important tasks. This means breaking down your project into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritizing them based on their impact on your overall goal. By focusing on what matters most, you can efficiently allocate your resources and avoid getting sidetracked by less critical tasks or distractions.

Another important aspect of programming is understanding the basics of the language or framework you're using. Mastering the fundamentals allows you to write cleaner, more efficient code, and makes it easier to troubleshoot issues as they arise. Always be willing to learn new techniques and tools, as this will help you become a better programmer and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of technology.
